Test run:

    gradle run -PappArgs="['<path to input file>']"

Proper usage:
    gradle build
    cd build/distributions
    unzip TextService.zip
    cd TextService/bin
    ./TextService <path to input file>

Initialization can take a few minutes depending on your disk's transfer rate.
Log can be found at `FileService.log`.

TODO:
1. Properly handle exceptions
2. Better logger
3. Maybe split classes differently
